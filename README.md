# Hand Detection and Hand Tracking Module

## Overview
This repository provides an easy-to-use Python module for **hand detection** and **hand tracking**, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate hand gesture recognition capabilities into their projects. The module is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision models for accurate detection and tracking.

### Key Features
- **Robust Hand Detection**: Detects multiple hands in real time with high accuracy.
- **Efficient Hand Tracking**: Tracks hand movements across frames for smooth gesture recognition.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Easily customize detection and tracking parameters.
- **Compatibility**: Works with live webcam streams, pre-recorded videos, and image files.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Utilizes pre-trained models for fast and reliable performance.

## Installation

To install the module, run the following command:
```bash
pip install hand-detection-tracking
```

## Quickstart Guide

Below is a simple example to get started with hand detection and tracking:

### Step 1: Import the Module
```python
from hand_detection_tracking import HandDetector, HandTracker
```

### Step 2: Initialize Hand Detector and Tracker
```python
detector = HandDetector(min_detection_confidence=0.7)
tracker = HandTracker(max_num_hands=2)
```

### Step 3: Process Video Stream
```python
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Open webcam

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Detect and track hands
    hands = detector.detect(frame)
    tracked_hands = tracker.track(hands, frame)

    # Visualize results
    for hand in tracked_hands:
        cv2.rectangle(frame, hand['bbox'], (0, 255, 0), 2)  # Draw bounding box

    cv2.imshow('Hand Detection and Tracking', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Advanced Features

### Customizing Parameters
Both the `HandDetector` and `HandTracker` classes provide several customizable parameters for fine-tuning:
- `min_detection_confidence`: Confidence threshold for hand detection.
- `max_num_hands`: Maximum number of hands to track.
- `tracking_confidence`: Confidence threshold for tracking consistency.

### Gesture Recognition
Integrate gesture recognition by leveraging hand landmarks provided by the tracker:
```python
for hand in tracked_hands:
    landmarks = hand['landmarks']
    # Use landmarks to implement custom gesture recognition logic
```

## Observability
Track performance metrics and debug easily with built-in observability features:
```python
from hand_detection_tracking import Observer

observer = Observer()
observer.run()

# Track latency and accuracy during runtime
```

## Dependencies
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and visualization.
- **Mediapipe**: For efficient hand detection and tracking models.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
